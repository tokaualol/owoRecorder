## What is this?
> This is a fork of a Minecraft autoclicker named "uwuRecorder" this program replays your clicks based on your click style or one of a leaderboard player's, however this version of the program has been modified to support the latest versions of Minecraft.

## How do I use this?
> First you check the record clicks checkbox, then start clicking in a supported Minecraft version. The program will record your clicks in real time. Once you have recorded enough clicks, export them. In order to replay the clicks, import your recorded clicks and tick the replay checkbox!

## Is this cheating?
> Autoclicking is bannable on some servers. I am not responsible for any actions that may be taken against you.

## Current Features
- Multiplier: Multiply the speed of your recorded clicks.
- Disable on Shift: Disables autoclicking when shifting.
- Smart Mode: Only clicks when in game and disables when Minecraft is not focused or in inventory/chest.
- Break Blocks: Break blocks while clicking.

## Supported Versions
- Vanilla (1.13 - 1.21.4)
- Fabric (1.13 - 1.21.4)
- Forge (1.13 - 1.21.4)
